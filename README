  Saveclock is a  daemon that restores the system clock from a file at start-up,
then periodically saves it back to the same file. This is particularly useful on
systems without a working hardware RTC clock, avoiding problems that may be
caused by a system believing it is still in 1970.
  The save period as well as the clock file can be specified on the
command line.
  Unlike fake-hwclock that features the same function, saveclock is not based
on shell scripts, but is a C-language daemon.
